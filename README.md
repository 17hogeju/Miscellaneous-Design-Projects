The BirdAnimation video is an incomplete story board for a synched music experience. The inspiration for this video came from a childhood memory of listening to the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra with my parents. 

The KritaCharacterDesign image is a replica of a character drawing(shown in the upper right corner)from a video game. I used a free photoshop-like tool called Krita and used layers and tools to create the shown effects.
